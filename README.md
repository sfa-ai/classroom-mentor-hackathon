# ClassRoom Mentor – Hackathon Submission

ClassRoom Mentor is a WhatsApp-based, just-in-time classroom support tool designed for government school teachers in India.

The tool supports teachers during live classroom teaching by providing calm, practical, and immediately usable guidance when unexpected situations arise.

## Problem Statement

Teachers often face unpredictable classroom situations during live teaching.
While trainings and workshops provide concepts, teachers lack on-the-spot support during the actual class.

ClassRoom Mentor addresses this gap by offering real-time, non-judgmental classroom support without disrupting teaching.

---

## Solution Overview

ClassRoom Mentor acts like a quiet senior colleague supporting the teacher during class.

Key characteristics:
- Designed for live classroom use
- Works on WhatsApp (no new app to learn)
- Gives short, practical suggestions usable within minutes
- Non-judgmental and privacy-respecting
- No diagnosis, no labeling, no evaluation

---

## How It Works

1. Teacher sends a message describing what is happening in class
2. The system asks only essential context (class, subject, situation)
3. The teacher receives:
   - What to do right now
   - One quick classroom activity
   - One tip for the next class
   - The basic skill supported
   - A short encouraging note

All guidance is optional. The teacher’s professional judgment is final.

## Architecture & Design

This project does not use a traditional codebase.

Instead, it is built using:
- Pickaxe (no-code AI application builder)
- Carefully designed system-level prompt architecture
- Controlled LLM configuration for safety and brevity
- WhatsApp Business integration via Twilio

Design principles:
- No data storage
- No long-term memory
- No automations or actions
- No student diagnosis or labeling
- Low-resource classroom realism

## Why There Is No Traditional Code Repository

The innovation in this project lies in:
- Prompt architecture
- Safety and ethics design
- Conversation flow
- Deployment through WhatsApp for accessibility

A traditional source-code repository is not applicable because the tool is implemented using a no-code platform optimized for rapid, safe deployment.

This approach ensures faster adoption and lower risk for teachers and schools.
